                            <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of design and
                                evolve,
                                something we hope
                                we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of
                                photographers,
                                designers, and creatives who
                                enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the
                                cities
                                we love. You'l also
                                occasionaly find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting
                                on
                                photography.</p>

                                Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur
                                photographers. We submit these
                                galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we
                                took
                                the picture at, or even what
                                lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to
                                participate, we'd love to have you. All
                                galeries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're
                                interested, drop us a line and tel us
                                what you have in mind.

                                We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'l let
                                everyone know and schedule
                                a meet up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city,
