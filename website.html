                    The goal of chess is to capture your opponent’s king; however, most games end before the capture
                    when the opponent is unable to prevent their king from being captured.
                    Checkmate occurs if you put your opponent’s king in check (meaning it is under direct threat) and
                    they are incapable of moving the king or blocking the threat with another piece. When this happens,
                    say “checkmate” out loud to declare the end of the game. Let your opponent double-check if they can
                    make a move before declaring yourself the winner!

                <p>
                    Chess is a board game played between two players that simulates a war between two kingdoms. It is
                    one of the most popular games in the world. Millions of people play it both recreationally and
                    competitively.
                    <br><br>
                    Chess is a turn-based strategy game with no hidden information. For this reason, the element of luck
                    is virtually non-existent in the game.

                                easiest way to remember this is with the phrase "white to the right." If your board has
                                numbers down the side, the line ("rank") with a 1 next to it goes on the side where
                                you'll line up the white pieces.</p>

                                at some
                                point, your opponent is likely to put your king in check (or perhaps you'll put their
                                king in check). This just means that if nothing changes, your opponent would capture
                                your king on their next move. When your opponent announces "check," you must do
                                something to get out of check. You have 3 basic options:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li><b>Evade:</b> Shuffle your king over one square so he's out of the attacking piece's
                                    line
                                    of attack.</li>
                                <li><b>Capture:</b> Use another piece to capture the piece your opponent is attacking
                                    with.
                                    Threat eliminated—whew!</li>

                                And that's the game! Your goal is to checkmate your opponent and protect your king so
                                your opponent can't checkmate you. Sounds simple, right? But with so many pieces in
                                play, the strategy and planning can get quite complex. Since you're just starting out,
                                focus on always protecting your king and you'll do fine.

                    <h4>Angelo V. Ropelos</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp; I began to an interest in chess in Grade 4 when my cousin
                        introduced me to the world of chess. Since then,
                        my interest in chess began to grow and I wanted to learn more
                        things and explore the world of chess. In continuing my journey
                        of chess I have met so many people and made new friends,
                        one of those friends is Francis. We made this website to inspire and motivate many beginners in
                        chess and to remind them to never give up because in every bad position there is always a way
                        out. So keep on fighting and grow. </p>

                    <h4>Francis James O. Omnos</h4>
                    <p>In elementary school, I started playing chess. My older brother introduced me to this game. I
                        became more interested in the realm of chess as I learned more about it. Angelo and I founded
                        Chess Mind with the goal of instructing newcomers and motivating them on their journey to become
                        professional players. For those who are new, keep trying. Examine your games! I promise that as
                        you advance, you will get better.</p>
